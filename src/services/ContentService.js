      "React Hooks Deep Dive": `üöÄ React Hooks Deep Dive: useState & useEffect

Mastering hooks is crucial for modern React development! Here's a quick guide:

‚ú® useState: Manages component state
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

‚ú® useEffect: Handles side effects
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = \`Count: \${count}\`;
}, [count]);

üí° Pro tip: Always specify dependencies in useEffect to avoid bugs!

      "React Performance Optimization": `‚ö° React Performance Optimization Tips

Is your React app feeling slow? Try these optimizations:

1. Use React.memo() for component memoization
2. Implement useCallback for functions
3. Use useMemo for expensive calculations
4. Code splitting with React.lazy()
5. Virtualize long lists

Example:
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return heavyCalculation(props.data);
}, [props.data]);

#React #Performance #JavaScript #WebDev #Optimization`,
    };
